## Article 6. Liabilities and Representations and Warranties

### 6.1. Operation of Sites and Services

To use the Services, Members must have the equipment, software, and parameters necessary for the correct operation of the services, including the latest version of an Internet browser, with JavaScript functions activated, Session cookies permitted and acceptance of pop-ups.

The use of the Services on a Mac requires the exclusive use of the Mozilla Firefox browser – BeRightBack does not guarantee optimal operation with the Safari or Opera browsers.

Notice: for the full use of our Services, you will need to have installed the latest version of the Adobe Flash software (downloadable from “www.adobe.com”).

Depending on your network configuration (protected by a firewall or proxy) the connection with our sites might not be possible.

Members must have the abilities, materials and software required for the use of the Internet or the Services mobile application, if applicable, the Internet services, and acknowledge that the nature and constraints of the Internet do not guarantee the security, availability and integrity of the transmission of data over the Internet or through mobile applications.

BeRightBack does not guarantee that the Services will be able to be used if Members use a “pop-up killer” tool; in this case, this function must be disabled prior to the use of the Services.

BeRightBack does not warrant that the Services will function properly if the Member’s Internet service provider fails to provide an adequate level of service. Similarly, if applicable, the use of smartphone applications, whose use Members have agreed on directly with the provider, requires Members to have a smartphone and a satisfactory connection.

Under these circumstances, BeRightBack is not responsible for any lack of functionality, lack of access or poor conditions of use of the Sites that would be attributable to equipment-related inadequacies, to the internal failures of Members’ access provider, the overloading of the Internet network and for any and all other reasons external to BeRightBack, which the Member agrees are events of force majeure.

The operation of the Services may be interrupted momentarily due to maintenance, updates or technical improvements, or to update the content and/or the way it is presented. To the extent possible, BeRightBack will notify their Members prior to any maintenance operations or updates.

### 6.2. Information and content provided by Members

**6.2.1.** Information provided by a Member to BeRightBack, must be accurate and true. A Member may disclose information voluntarily and the consequences that disclosing this information may have on the Member’s life or the lives of other Members are the exclusive responsibility of the Member in question. The Member, on its own account, discloses and disseminates information, data, texts, content and images that concern it through the Services. Accordingly, the Member waives the right to make any claim against BeRightBack, in particular on the basis of the possible infringement of its image rights, honour, reputation or privacy of its private life, that may result from the distribution or dissemination of information that concern it under the terms and conditions established in the Terms of Use, in particular, Article 5, “Members’ Privacy and Data Protection”, to the extent that the Member has previously given its voluntary and express consent to such dissemination as a result of its registration with the Services and in application of the Terms of Use.

**6.2.2.** BeRightBack cannot be held liable for the accuracy or inaccuracy of the information and content provided by other Members, visitors to the Sites and/or the Member itself (and the consequences of reliance on any such information). Similarly, BeRightBack cannot be held liable for any content disseminated by a Member that may potentially constitute a breach of the rights of one or more of the other Members or third parties, where a member of BeRightBack can demonstrate that it: (i) was not informed by a Member or third party, or about the content or the dissemination, (ii) did not have actual or prior knowledge of the same or (iii) did not commit a breach in the performance of any of its contractual obligations which led to such content being disseminated.

BeRightBack may only be held liable by a Member if and to the extent there is proof of a breach having been committed by BeRightBack or one of its service providers involved in the performance of the BeRightBack’s contractual obligations, and this breach has caused the Member direct damage. Where appropriate, it will be BeRightBack’s responsibility to demonstrate that it has not committed any breaches in the performance of its contractual obligations. BeRightBack may not be held liable for any direct or indirect damage incurred by the Member in the event the Member causes the damage or the damage results from an event of force majeure.

**6.2.3.** The quality of the Services demanded by both BeRightBack and its Members requires that Members conduct themselves ethically, and behave with respect for the rights of third parties, and the respect for the laws and regulations in force. To meet this demand for quality, individual responsibility and ethics, BeRightBack requests any Member to report any data (photography, text, video), behaviours or comments made by another Member that appear to be in violation of the laws and regulations in force, concerning the purpose of the Services, third-party rights or public morals.

As a result, Members acknowledge and accept that the data they provide, as well as their behaviour or comments made through the Services, may be reported by other Members or End Users and are subject to acts of moderation and/or oversight by BeRightBack on the basis of objective assessment criteria. In the event that BeRightBack’s investigation of a report reveals that a Member violated the laws and regulations in force or its contractual obligations, the provisions of the Terms of Use, in particular, Article 8 entitled “Termination”, may be applied. Depending on the Members’ behaviour or the comments made by Members, the monitoring team may decide to block any new registration by a Member that has been the subject of a complaint.

**6.2.4.** In the event BeRightBack is held liable on the basis of a Member’s breach of its legal obligations or those under the Terms of Use, said Member agrees to indemnify and hold BeRightBack harmless against any orders issued against it resulting from the Member’s breach of its obligations.

### 6.3. Links and external resources

BeRightBack is only liable for the hyperlinks it creates, and does not exercise any control over the External Websites and external resources (third-party websites or mobile applications, social networks, etc.) to which the hyperlinks accessible on the Sites and the Services redirect and which BeRightBack did not create. It cannot be held liable for the provision of hyperlinks to External Websites, and cannot be held liable for their content, advertisements, products, service features or any other information available on or based on the use of such External Websites.

Any issues relating to a link must be submitted to the administrator or webmaster of the site in question. A Member’s access and/or use of these sources and External Websites may be governed by third party terms and conditions over which BeRightBack has no control.

Finally, if during the course of using the Sites, the use of the Sites leads a Member to pages that include External Websites, pages or forums whose title and/or content constitutes a violation of applicable law, that Member is requested to terminate its use of the Sites, or navigate to, the External Website in question. Members who continue to search, or navigate to, such External Websites proceed at their own risk, and BeRightBack will not be liable for the content of External Websites.

### 6.4 Indemnity

You agree to indemnify us (including our directors, officers, employees, subcontractors, agents and affiliated companies) against all third party claims and liabilities related to your breach of this Agreement and/or to your use of the Services.

### 6.5 Functioning of the Site and Services

To use the Services, the Member must have the necessary hardware equipment and software and the necessary parameters required to properly use the website e.g. access to the Internet. Members are also advised to have JavaScript functions, cookies and pop-ups enabled.

The Member must have the skills, hardware and software required to use the Internet or, as appropriate, Internet, telephone and mobile Services, and acknowledges that the characteristics and constraints of the Internet mean that the security, availability and integrity of Internet data transmissions cannot be guaranteed.

We do not guarantee that the Services will function if the Member activates a pop-up killing tool. In this case, the function should be deactivated before using the Service.

We do not guarantee that the Services will be usable if the Member’s Internet Service Provider (“ISP”) is unable to provide its services properly. In this context, we cannot be held responsible for the non-functioning, unavailability or adverse conditions of usage of the website resulting from incorrect hardware, problems experienced by the Member’s ISP or blockages on the Internet networks or for all other reasons outside our sphere of influence. Moreover, due amongst other things to the specifics of their Internet browser, Members connecting through AOL may encounter problems making our sites function properly. Furthermore, smartphone applications are only available to our Members in possession of the smartphone handset and Internet access is required.

Under these conditions, we do not guarantee that the Services shall function without interruption or error. In particular, the use of our website may be interrupted at any time for the purposes of maintenance, updates or technical improvements, or to develop its content and/or presentation. Whenever possible, we shall inform Members prior to maintenance work or updates.

Apple users should use Mozilla Firefox - we do not guarantee optimal functioning of the website when using Safari or Opera browsers.

Please note that up-to-date Adobe Flash software may be required for this website to function properly (download from: http://adobe.com/getflash). Depending on your network configuration (if protected behind a firewall or proxy), connection to our Messenger service may not be possible.

## Article 7. Termination

Members may terminate their subscription to the Services by requesting the closing of their BeRightBack account at any time without reason by making a request through [pleasedontgo@berightback.travel](mailto:pleasedontgo@berightback.travel) or by any means which may be indicated under this heading. This request will be deemed made on the working day following the receipt by BeRightBack of the request to close the account concerned. This request will not entail reimbursement to the Member of the period remaining until the Member Subscription expires.

The termination of a Subscription by a Member takes effect on the expiry date of the current Subscription, provided that notice was made by the Member to BeRightBack no later than fourteen (14) days prior to the expiry date of the current Subscription.

Without prejudice to the other provisions of the Terms of Use, in the event of a serious breach of the Terms of Use by the Member, BeRightBack will terminate the Member’s account without prior notice or formal notice. This termination will have the same effect as the termination by the Member.

This termination will take effect without prejudice to any damages BeRightBack, the BeRightBack Group Companies, its or their successors and_or authorized representatives may claim from Members as compensation for losses incurred by BeRightBack and_or its successors and/or authorised representatives as a result of these breaches.

The Member will be notified by e-mail of the termination or confirmation of the termination of its account. Data relating to the Member will be destroyed at the request of the Member or at the expiry of the current statutory period from the termination of the Member’s account.

As indicated in Article 4 of these Terms of Use, the Member may also subscribe to other one-time services. Where applicable, these one-time services are purchased from other service providers and subject to other payment terms and conditions than those used for the Services offered by BeRightBack, which are issued by the other relevant service provider. The billing and payment terms and conditions and the terms of renewal specific to these one-time services and special offers will be given to the Member and accepted by the Member by the relevant service provider prior to purchase.

## Article 8. Agreement with the Member

These Terms of Use constitute a contract that governs relations between the Member and BeRightBack. These Terms of Use supersede all previous provisions not expressly referred to or appended and constitute the entire rights and obligations of BeRightBack and the Member with respect to their subject matter.

If one or more provisions in the Terms of Use are held to be unenforceable under applicable laws or regulations or as a result of a final decision of a competent court, the other provisions will remain in full force and effect, to the extent permitted by that decision. Furthermore, the failure of a Party to act with respect to a breach by the other Party of any of the provisions of these Terms of Use does not in any way imply a waiver of the right to act at a later date with respect to that breach.

## Article 9. Modification of the Services or Terms of Use

BeRightBack may amend these Terms of Use at any time. Notice of the nature of these amendments will be sent to Members as soon as they are posted on the Sites. The amendments will come into effect one month after they are posted on the Sites. With respect to Members registering after the amendments are posted on the Sites, these amendments will immediately apply, as they will have expressly accepted them by becoming Members. Upon the issuing of an amendment to a Member, the Member will have several options:

### 9.1. The Subscription initially taken out by the Member has not yet expired

In this case, the Member may choose to comply instead with the Terms of Use that were in force on the date that the Member’s initial Subscription started until the expiry of that initial Subscription.

### 9.2. The Member’s initial Subscription period has expired

In this case, the Member may implement the procedure referred to in Article 8 entitled “Termination” at any time during the four (4) months following the date of entry into force of the new Terms of Use. Beyond this four-month period, if the Member has not made known its intention to terminate its account, the Member’s acceptance of the new Terms of Use is implied.

Members are accordingly invited to consult the version of the Terms of Use in force available on the Sites at all times.

## Article 10. Applicable law - Disputes
