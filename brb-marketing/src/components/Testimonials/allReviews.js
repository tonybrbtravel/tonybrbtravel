    reviewTitle: 'Great idea, reality exceeded my expectations!',
    reviewBody:
      "I was so excited by this concept and Alex and the team have delivered above and beyond my expectations! Great communication before, during and after signing up and first trip, really flexible and helpful with any queries. Our first surprise location was Lisbon for a few surprisingly sunny and relaxing days full of sightseeing and tasty food/wine. Our hotel was really nice with lovely staff and was perfectly located in the central Baixa district where we spent most of our time, and we could easily jump on a bus/tram/train to get to other places like Belem and Sintra. Can't wait for our next trip!!!",

      "BRB takes all the stress out of booking a trip and the price makes travel accessible to so many that I don't know why you wouldn't sign up. The surprise element keeps you excited for your upcoming adventure and the fact you know you have another trip in the not too distant future means travelling home isn't too heartbreaking. 10/10 reccoemdn and could not fault the team one bit!",

    reviewTitle: 'brb, my New Years resolution for travel sorted!',
    reviewBody:
      'Being able to seemlesly travel with a partner on a regular basis was what attracted me to the brb concept. The hotel we were booked was very good and close to Termini train station and most of the main sights. We explored the main part of the city on foot and went to the Colosseum, the Roman Forum and the Spanish steps! Three days was the perfect amount of time for us and considering we didnâ€™t have to organise anything, this was the perfect experience. All in all I love this company! Who wouldnâ€™t like to receive an amazing surprise destination every few months?!? Itâ€™s like Christmas morning 3x a year! ðŸ™Œ',

    reviewTitle: 'I never make time for taking holidays...',
    reviewBody:
      'I never make time for taking holidays, mostly because time gets away from me before Iâ€™ve taken a break. This is why I chose to sign up to BRB. For my first trip I was sent to Sofia in Bulgaria on the â€˜Chill Outâ€™ option. I spent my time on a free walking tour, listening to podcasts on Entale as I walked about the city and then went on a not so chilled bar crawl (highly recommend Bar "Bar", a complete dive bar on the side of a really nice park, the owners have it legally protected from redevelopment as a site of "cultural importance".).',

    reviewTitle: 'Highly recommend',
    reviewBody:
      'I would have recommended this company to others. I loved the concept from the beginning, it forces you to take a break and pushes you outside your comfort zone. The fact that the location was not something I had planned extensively for, I found that I relaxed and enjoyed myself more than I may have done. The hotel that booked was as promised, excellent accommodation and location.',

    reviewTitle: 'Awesome',
    reviewBody:
      'Awesome - what an experience. I was flown out to Barcelona on Thursday afternoon, and stayed for 2 nights in a clean and well located hotel. Alex was really communicative, and helpful. The entire experience was soooo seamless especially considering the potential for travel being stressful. Really really looking forward to the next trip!!!',

    reviewTitle: 'Love BRB!',
    reviewBody:
      "BRB sent us to Amsterdam and we had the best ever time. Everything from start finish with this company is amazing. The small monthly payments make going away really affordable and your putting money towards a holiday without thinking it! Alex was excellent at communicating everything beforehand and felt like we were in safe hands! You find your destination a month before you go - which builds and keeps the excitement! Normally you book a holiday and sort of forget about it! However with this way, you keep thinking 'I wonder where we are going' etc and then when the excitement just keeps going when you get the reveal! Thanks Alex and the team - we had a fantastic time and we highly recommend to everyone :)",

    reviewBody:
      'The surprise destination that I was sent on was Iceland. I was completely shocked when the destination was revealed - Iâ€™ve dreamt about planning a trip to Iceland for as long as I can remember. From the moment I landed, everything felt seamless. The accommodation was really comfortable and within walking distance to the entertainment area. An absolutely breathtaking experience that I will never forget.',

      'I love this product - it removes all the hassle out of saving for, planning, and booking a trip. At the price of effectively three Deliveroo take-outs per month, you get to hit your yearly travel goals.',
